# Heuristic for approximating the value of pi!

This repo contains my solution, in python, to the coding challenge below, proposed by Joma Tech in one of his videos:

> "*Given the ability to get random numbers between 0 and 1, calculate the value of pi*"

## Running

If you want to check out my solution first hand, just clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/CaioHPerlin/approximate-pi`

And run the file [`approximate.py`](https://github.com/CaioHPerlin/approximate-pi/blob/master/approximate.py) through your preferred terminal:

`python approximate.py`

The program will then prompt you to enter the number of points to be considered. In essence, the higher the value you input, the closer the output will approximate the value of pi
